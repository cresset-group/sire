Importing Sire
==============

Start a Python session (e.g. an interactive python console or a
Jupyter notebook).

You import Sire by typing

>>> import Sire

.. note::

   Note how this tutorial uses ``>>>`` to show a command that you should
   type into an interactive Python session, such as an ipython console or
   Jupyter notebook

As a convention, we will import the :mod:`Sire` Python module under the alias
`sr` to reduce the amount of typing. We will use `sr` throughout this tutorial to
mean :mod:`Sire`.

>>> import Sire as sr
