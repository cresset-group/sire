    /** This is a Node in a cluster. A Node is a resource that can
        be used to run WorkPackets. A Node is always part of a
        'Nodes' scheduler object, that coordinates the WorkPackets
        that are assigned to the nodes. Alternatively, you can
        grab a node manually from the Nodes object and you can
        assign WorkPackets to it yourself

        Essentially, a Node is a means of directing WorkPackets
        to Frontends, so that they can be communicated on to
        Backends that perform the actual work.
